bigram project for VAE

This project is for the job with VAE to create tests and code for bigrams.  

In this project I started by created each test first and then creating the code to fit the test.  I created tests for looking at one sentence with a period to more complex with punctuation like comma, semi-colon, exclamiation and question marks.  Two sentences were also tested and if needed could have done a whole paragraph.

This would only create bigrams after the first word of each sentence.  The delimiter that was used was a space for each word.

This doesn't take into account special characters in the word or at the beginning or end of the word.  This doesn't take into account apostrophes or hyphens.
